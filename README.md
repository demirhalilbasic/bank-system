# üí≥ Bank System Project

The Bank System Project represents my first significant work in an OOP environment. The work is written in the C++ programming language, using a large part of the capabilities of this programming language, such as classes with attributes and methods, inheritance, vectors, structures, etc.

The project of the bank system is based primarily on CRUD functionalities that bring admin and user panel. On the administrator's side, account management options are provided in the database (current and savings accounts), as well as user account management (admin and regular users). The user side offers interesting features such as transferring money from one account to another, viewing the current amount on the account, as well as the history of all transactions that have been made. There are also credit options, where only creditworthy people can borrow a certain amount. A user can be associated with one account, but this can also be changed through the admin panel.

The system is full of many benefits and has been carefully designed to adapt to each user. It is modular and represents a good basis for further development and improvement. I recommend watching the YouTube video below in order to further understand the principles and algorithms of the system's functioning, but also to see what the system brings through the command line interface.
